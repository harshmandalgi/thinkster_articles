__INFERIORITY:-__

“Believe in yourself, take on challenges , dig deep within yourself
to conquer fears. Never let anyone bring you down. You got to
keep going.”-CHANTAL SUTHERLAND 

Do you feel minuscule and less consequential when some big-name
walk past you, leaving you feeling like a trashed can? The
perception of feeling small or less important is what is defined as
inferiority complex. All said and done, the feeling of inferiority is all
in the mind. Excessive criticism, dissuasion and low self-esteem can
trigger a feeling of inferiority in one’s mind, leaving you feeling
utterly helpless and in throes of dismay and mental anguish.
Yes, I know your question will be how you will get to know that you
have inferiority complex or not?
Here are some signs through which we can identify inferiority
complex they are: 
Social Withdrawal
People with inferiority complex usually feel uncomfortable being
around others, particularly in a crowded place. This is because of an
imagined belief that others would soon find out that they don’t fit into
the group, causing them to feel embarrassed. People with inferiority
complex often have trouble making new friends or maintaining the
ones they have, because they feel they are not good enough and the
friends may not like them. 
Fault Finding
A key sign of inferiority complex is the urge to make others feel
inadequate or incompetent too. An individual with an inferiority
complex is not driven by the need to achieve or succeed at something,
therefore, they do not train their minds to recognize and compliment
the positive attributes of others. To feel better about themselves, such

individuals tend to make others feel bad about themselves too by
finding faults and pointing out the wrong things about others.  
Performance Anxiety
An individual with inferiority complex already feels they can’t
achieve as much as others in a certain task, therefore, if placed in a
situation where they have to complete a task, they may feel very
apprehensive. You may find yourself feeling so anxious when asked
to sing a song or operate a device, for instance. This occurs because of
the fear of failure or the fear of being laughed at or criticized,
resulting from your feeling of inadequacy and belief that you cannot
perform the task. 
Craving for Attention
An individual with an inferiority complex has a strong need to be
loved and validated. Inferiority complex robs an individual of a
healthy sense of self and sense of worth, so they seek to receive
validation from others. These people usually need to be flattered and
are dependent on such flattery for their happiness. They may pretend
to be ill or unhappy so as to get attention or cheer from others.
Increased sensitivity
People with an inferiority complex are highly sensitive to what others
do, think, or say about them. They do not take compliments or
criticisms well and may become overly aggressive when they are
criticized. This occurs because such critical comments about them
reinforce their own thoughts about themselves, and in trying to defend
or protect themselves, they become aggressive or overly emotional.
Easily Feeling Disrespected
Individuals with inferiority complex often neglect their needs and
emotions in order to be liked by others. They put their needs last so as
to continue receiving attention from others. You may find yourself
tolerating several episodes of abuse from your relationship partner,

for instance. This is usually a result of your lack of self-esteem and
poor boundaries.
The apparent cause seem to be the fact you are inferior to others
around you in a particular manner: you’re short, you’re fat, you’re
bold, you’re poor, you’re less educated etc. However, there are many
more reasons they are:
Parental upbringing – Children who are brought up by caregivers
who are disapproving and always critical of their actions and
performance are at a high risk of developing a low self-esteem and
inferiority complex.
Social Limitations – Discrimination against an individual based on
their family, race, sex, socio-economic status, educational level,
religion, and sexual orientation may place them at a risk of inferiority
complex.
Physical defects – Some defects in appearance, such as weight issues,
visual defects, skin diseases, burn wounds, may trigger feelings of
self-doubt and low self-esteem in some individuals. Other physical
features such as speech defects including stuttering may also lead to
feelings of inferiority complex.
Overcoming an Inferiority Complex
Basically, overcoming an inferiority complex implies a set of key
shifts in thinking:
 Realizing that any flaw you have is not as bad as you think;
 Realizing that having a certain flaw does not equal with not
having any personal qualities;
 Realizing that all people have their flaws and most people have
major flaws.
And when I say ‘realizing’ all of these, I’m referring to taking them in
and making them a part of your automatic, everyday thinking.
